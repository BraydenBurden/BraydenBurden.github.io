            <p id="about_p1"> Brayden is a Software Development student at The College of the North Atlantic. He grew up always playing
            video games or just playing on a computer. He was always interested in how programs on the computer were
            built, or how websites were made, anything to do with computers or technology. One day his brother gave
            him a programming book and he took it upon himself to try to learn it. This book unlocked a passion, so
            it seemed like the Software Development program was a perfect fit for him.</p>

            <p id="about_p2"> In the software development program, he is currently learning many useful things that he really enjoys! He
            loves learning new things such as python programming, building websites and creating and managing databases.
            The workload can be quite challenging but problem solving makes him excited. After he finishes his college
            program, he is planning to apply for the computer science program at Memorial University of Newfoundland
            and work my way up to a master’s degree in computer science. He intends to keep learning new and relevant
            things that relate to programming and software development.</p>
    
            <p id="about_p3"> Brayden’s eagerness and his determination to learn has helped him complete his latest database lab. It seemed
            very hard at first, but he researched and read articles for hours to help him finish the lab correctly, He considered
            this a big accomplishment that will help him out in all his workload. A lot of the labs and assignments are
            challenging at first but staying determined and excited to see the outcome makes it easy to work on for hours
            until he gets it right.</p>
                    
            <p id="about_p4"> Currently Brayden is browsing websites to find projects for him to work on and improve his newly learned skills. He
            is interested in projects that will challenge him and make him a better software developer. You can contact Brayden
            at brayden.burden91@ed.cna.nl.ca if you have any ideas or projects for him to work on!</p>
